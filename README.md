Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This is a program that creates two clocks a 12 hour and 24 hour clock.  It then can add 1 hour, minute or second to the clock.

What did you do particularly well?
  I was able to do the functions well, for just doing them in C++.  The switch call was also new to me and was able to do it OK>

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  The code could have added some color to the clock, that we learned later.  I would also like to add a way to change the time by more the one.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  Coding the switch code, I needed help with.  I used Stack Overflow - Where Developers Learn, Share, & Build Careers, for help with the code.
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  I have used the case code in other projects.  I was an easy way to call different functions from a menu.  I had problems using this code when using two different 
  programing languages.  I used for that code an if else statement.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  I included lots of comments in the code, maybe too much.  I have noticed with too many comments the code gets kind of messy.  I have been trying to only comment key 
  code points and blocks of code.
